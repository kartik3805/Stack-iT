"Stack iT" is a basic block stacking game for all Chrome-based browsers with compelling game logic. As a personal effort, I created this game.

Just give it a shot; I'm confident you won't be able to put it down.

Use "RIGHT CLICK" or "SPACE BAR" as input



## Installation

Enable Developer Mode and use Load unpacked to install the extension

```bash
  >>>For Chrome Browser:
        More tools → extensions → toggle developer mode → load unpacked

  ```
